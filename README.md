# page-builder: Code Blocks

Code Blocks can contain styles and javascript that only runs when you preview or load the live page. They can add extra functionality to your pages.

Note that these need to be thoroughly tested by you before launching your page! It is functionality outside of the normal operation of the platform.

Many of these code blocks assume you have the jQuery library loaded in your template. If you do not, then you can add it via a line in your template's `<head>`, e.g.:
  
```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
